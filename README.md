# Clipboard
Clipboard is a minimal text/file drop and url shortener. It is meant for a single user deploying it on their own domain for personal use.

The basic premise is that the user on their own device can "unlock" the website. Once it is unlocked, anyone can upload text, a url, or a file. Then, anyone can access that content on the clipboard.

It uses Cloudflare Workers, Workers KV, and R2.
